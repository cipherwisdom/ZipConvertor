# Automation Script for Data Processing

## Overview
This automation script is designed to process data from a CSV file, perform various operations on it, and generate a final output in the form of a well-formatted Excel file. The script includes the following features:

- Filtering specific columns from the CSV file.
- Formatting the timestamp column from UTC to GST format.
- Applying borders and alignment to cells in the Excel file.
- Creating a zip archive of the resulting Excel file.

## Getting Started

- Required Python packages (you can install them using `pip install package-name`):
  - pandas
  - openpyxl

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
